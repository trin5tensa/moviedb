Move mainwindow.py altogether. 
Move common support functions from guiwidgets_2 to commonsupport.py.
Move odds and ends functions from guiwidgets_2 to oddends.py (about, settings, messageboxes).
Move tag functions from guiwidgets_2 to tags.py.
Move guiwidgets_2, which, by now, only contains movie code, to movies.py.
