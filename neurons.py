    Use Case:
    Input forms often have multiple fields one of which must be completed before the form can be

    For example, a 'Search' button should only be active if any field that can be used for the search
    is completed. This requires an observer that responds to multiple stimuli. It will react when
    any observed field sends True.

    Usage:
    1) Instantiate Neuron.
    2) Register events. Events which could notify an OrNeuron may be registered at any time prior to
    their use.
    3) Call the parent method 'register' to register one or more closures. Each closure will execute the
    action required in a target object (e.g. Activate a button). The target object could be another
    neuron.
    4) Call <neuron object>(<event id>, state). This will notify the registered notifees with 'True'
    if any of the events are 'True' otherwise with 'False'.
    5) Call the parent method deregister to remove a notifee.
